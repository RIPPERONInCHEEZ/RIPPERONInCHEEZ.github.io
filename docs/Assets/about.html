      <h2>The Story</h2>
      <p>
        PixelFunk Studios is a pipedream passion project started by Kevin
        "cheez" Dickinson. It will hopefully blossom into a place where I can
        showcase all of my works be it Game Development, Coding, Computer and IT
        knowledge, Graphic Design, as well as maybe a random blog post or two.
        It will also be a place I can use to continue to learn HTML. This
        website will be created interly by myself...Im sure I will update this
        more in the future.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Currently the mission is to continue learning and hopefully create a
        cool game and grow and network. I am starting with website design and
        learning HTML as that will come in handy in the long run and is a good
        jumping off point.
